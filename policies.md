- **Final Review:** All deliverables will undergo a final review by the team before submission.

## Version Control Guidelines
- **Branching Strategy:**  
  - Use feature branches for development (`feature/feature-name`).  
  - Merge to the `main` branch after approval.  
- **Commit Messages:**  
  - Use descriptive commit messages following the format:  
    ```
    [Feature/Task] Short description of the change
    ```
- **Code Reviews:**  
  - All pull requests require at least one team member's review before merging.  

---

## Conflict Resolution
- **Open Communication:** Encourage open communication to resolve disagreements.  
- **Vote-Based Decisions:** If consensus cannot be reached, a majority vote will determine the outcome.
